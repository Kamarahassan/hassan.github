            <h2>General Advise to Help You in Your Educational  journey </h2>
            <p>
              Becoming a reader is the single most important thing that you can do to
              help the child to succeed in school and in life. The importance of reading simply cant
              be overstated. Reading helps children in all school subjects. More important, it is the key
              to lifelong learning. Here are some tips on how to help you become a reader:
            </p>
            <p><b>Start early</b>. When your child is still a baby, reading aloud to him* should become part
                    of your daily routine. At first, read for no more than a few minutes at a time, several
                    times a day. As your child grows older, you should be able to tell if he wants you to
                    read for longer periods. As you read, talk with your child. Encourage him to ask
                    questions and to talk about the story. Ask him to predict what will come next. When
                    your child begins to read, ask him to read to you from books or magazines that he
                    enjoys.</p>

                Every child has the power to succeed in school and in life and every parent, family
                member and caregiver can help. The question is: How can we help our children succeed?
                The answer comes from a combination of common sense and research about how
                children learn and about how to prepare them to learn.
         </p>
         <p>
                We know, for example, that children tend to do the same things as their parents do. What
                we say and do in our daily lives can help them to develop positive attitudes toward school
                and learning and to build confidence in themselves as learners. Showing our children that
                we both value education and use it in our daily lives provides them with powerful models
                and contributes greatly to their success in school.
